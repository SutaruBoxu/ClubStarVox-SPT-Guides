# The Club StarVox SPT Guides
This will be a repository for the practices and observations of Club StarVox in SPT.

The project was started by StarVox for YouTube, grew on Discord, and gained a handful of contributors.  
Information and files will have been provided by StarVox and that handful of Club StarVox peers.  
In particular, user NoFear1979 has carried out numerous test runs with co-developed configurations and shared the data in a spreadsheet.
