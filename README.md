# ClubStarVox SPT Guides
This will be a repository for the practices and observations of Club StarVox in SPT.
What began as a Google Site will now expand into a GitHub repository with markdown, imagery, and files for SPT configuration.

The project was started by StarVox for YouTube, grew on Discord, and gained a handful of contributors.
Information and files will have been provided by StarVox and that handful of Club StarVox peers. 
In particular, user NoFear1979 has carried out numerous test runs with co-developed configurations and shared the data in a spreadsheet.

Club StarVox works in close communication with some SPT mod developers and collects comments from a growing YouTube audience.
Send any suggestions for the content of this repository to StarVox in the Club StarVox Discord server.
